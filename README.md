### T. brucei Swimming Dynamics
**Lab:** Zhou Lab, Mount Holyoke College  
I study how *Trypanosoma brucei* parasites swim differently when confined in microchannels compared to bulk fluid. The parasites interact with channel walls through hydrodynamic forces, which change their trajectories and can lead to interesting collective dynamics. I use high-speed microscopy to track individual parasites in custom 3D-printed microfluidic devices, then analyze the trajectories to extract swimming parameters and test predictions from active matter theory. Additionally, this work involves maintaining parasite cultures under BSL-2 conditions and optimizing imaging protocols.


### Topology Optimization for Turbulent Flows
**Lab:** Linot Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst  
I am currently co-authoring a paper with Professors Alec Linot and Saketh Sridhara. Our research expands a topology optimization framework for complex fluid flows that uses automatic differentiation with JAX, allowing it to handle turbulent flows in addition to laminar flows. This approach improves the efficiency and accuracy of flow optimization in complex fluid systems.


### Detection of Lagrangian Coherent Structures in Chaotic Fluid Systems
**Lab:** Spencer Smith’s Lab, Mount Holyoke College  
I developed and optimized algorithms for detecting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in high-dimensional, chaotic fluid systems, enabling precise identification of transport barriers and coherent motion. I built Python-based computational pipelines leveraging numerical linear algebra, time-series analysis, and topological data techniques to extract dynamic flow features from large datasets. Additionally, I applied computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle tracking to quantify emergent transport phenomena, linking chaotic advection to biologically relevant transport and collective motion. I validated these algorithms against simulated and experimental flow fields, improving both the accuracy and computational efficiency of LCS detection through careful optimization of numerical methods and parameter tuning.

### Set Theory as the best Foundation for Mathematics
**Supervisor:** Owen Griffiths, University of Cambridge
I explored the role of set theory as a foundational framework for mathematics, analyzing its ability to rigorously define numbers, functions, and mathematical structures. I investigated how alternative foundations compare and evaluated the implications of set-theoretic axioms for consistency, completeness, and the development of modern mathematical reasoning. This work was published in a peer-reviewed journal.


### Course Projects
Significant projects from advanced physics and biology courses:
- **Functional Characterization of CYP1A2 Genetic Variants, BIOL-210: Molecular Genetics** - Examined how genetic variation at the CYP1A2 locus influences caffeine metabolism using PCR, restriction digest, Sanger sequencing, and quantitative analysis of metabolic kinetics.
- **Entropy Changes and Emergent Alignment of Trypanosoma brucei
in Physical Confinement, PHYS-326: Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics** - Analyzed how physical confinement alters the collective behavior of T. brucei parasites using trajectory data to quantify entropy reduction, emergent alignment, and order-disorder transitions, applying principles of statistical mechanics to interpret collective motion.
